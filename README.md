# About "Enchanted Elves" skin for PlaneShift

"Enchanted Elves" skin is based on Elves GUI skin version 2.0 for PlaneShift 0.5, with some fixes and enchantements. Original creators Cherppow &amp; Vengeance. Special thanks to Rizin, Lanarel, weltall, Xordan and LigH. And my special thanks to Bonifarzia.

## Common Goals

* Be visually compatible with defaut "Elves v2" skin
* Add some polishing to it and improve usability
* Increase compactness (not dramatically)
* Be "Better "Elves v2" :) At least to some players...

## Plans and ideas
   
* Add numeric representation to mana and HP in Info window (like in BoNeSkin, but not % - don't know how)
* Add progressbars to Weigth and Capacity in inventory
* Use less decorative font for book writing
* Add separate background to Book writing window (not to scale readbook.png)  
* Add spellcheck to char description
